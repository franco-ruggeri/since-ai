    "why": "To show the monthly sales trends over time and capture how sales for the specific product A change in the year 2024, the line plot is optimal. It effectively visualizes trends over a time series with clear continuous time structures (each month in this case) for a single series.",

        ],
        "why": "Monthly bar chart is an alternative; while comparable in resolving trends, it intermittently misleads by emphasizing discrete differences in sales quantities between months, without inherently portraying the continuous change ideally depicted with line plots."

        "why": "To emphasize monthly trends, consolidating the temporal focus to monthly will be useful but a line plot, structured with time-axis as 'date.month', suffices. Reducing visual complexity maintains interpretability in this case."
