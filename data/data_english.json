        "translation": "Analysis of safety observations on stairs (2024)\nBased on this simulated data, a total of 14 safety observations were made in 2024 that were directly related to stairs or stairs.\nThe most common safety observations on stairs can be classified as follows:\n1. Tripping hazard (2 observations) This is the single most common cause. It is caused by obstacles or items left on the stairs that can cause tripping.\nExamples: \"Items left on the stairs\", \"Garbage left on the stairs\".\n2. Structural deficiencies (5 observations) This category includes defects related to the structure of stairs, such as broken steps, wobbly railings or inadequate lighting.\nExamples: \"Wobbly handrail on stairs\", \"Inadequate lighting on stairs\", \"Stair anti-slip detachment\", \"Stair step broken\".\n3. Slip hazard (4 observations) This category includes observations where the slipperiness of the stairs has increased, for example, due to splashes, weather or worn surfaces.\nExamples: \"Slippery stairs\", \"Liquid splash on stairs\", \"Wet rag on stairs\".\n4. Incorrect action or behaviour (3 observations) This category includes observations in which a person's own actions cause a dangerous situation, such as running or carrying objects that block the field of vision.\nExamples: \"An employee ran up the stairs\", \"Carried a large box up the stairs\"",

        "translation": "Analysis: Safety Observations vs. Correction requests\nBased on this simulated data, 18 observations can be classified as ordinary repair or maintenance requests that have been incorrectly reported as safety observations.\nHow was the difference defined?\nSafety observation: A situation or deficiency that poses an immediate or potential risk to the health or safety of an employee. The risk may be related to an accident (slipping, falling, crushing), an occupational disease (exposure, ergonomics) or damage to property (fire, machine breakdown).\nExample of material: \"Missing machine guard\" – poses a clear risk of entrapment and injury.\nExample of material: \"Cable in a passageway\" – poses a clear risk of tripping and injury.\nCorrection request (mistakenly as a safety observation): A deficiency that is of the nature of a defect, inconvenience or defect, but does not cause an active safety risk. These are often matters related to maintenance, cleanliness or property management.\nAn example of the material: \"Leaking faucet\" – needs to fix the fault and wastes water, but does not pose a safety risk in this case.\nExample of the material: \"Worn chair upholstery\" – is a purely aesthetic nuisance without a safety significance.\nExample of material: \"Wall clock stopped\" – is a functional nuisance, but does not endanger anyone.\nSummary of the comparison\nIn the 2024 data, the majority (about 70%) of the observations were genuine safety risks that required immediate attention. However, a significant proportion (about 30%) of the reports concerned minor defects and deficiencies.\nThis is a common phenomenon in organisations with a low threshold for reporting. Although it can put a strain on the safety system, it is often also a sign of a good safety culture, where staff are vigilant and report even the smallest deviations. The most important thing is the process by which these findings are correctly classified and controlled: urgent safety risks are prioritized and corrected immediately, while others are directed to the normal maintenance work queue.",

        "translation": "Analysis of safety observations due to urgency (March 2024)\nBased on this more extensive simulated material, a total of 20 safety observations were made in March, the root cause of which can be identified as being in a hurry.\nThe observations were identified either by direct mention (\"in a hurry\", \"hastily\", \"quickly\") or by actions that strongly indicate hurry and ignoring safety instructions (taking a shortcut, running, bypassing safety devices).\nThe most typical safety risk caused by rushing\nWhen examining these 20 observations, the most typical risk related to rushing was preventing or endangering the use of routes and safety equipment.\nThis general risk is clearly distinguishable from the data and manifests itself in the following ways:\nObstruction of safety devices and areas (5 observations): This was the most common single manifestation. In a hurry, items such as trolleys and trolleys were left in places where they blocked access to the emergency stop button, emergency shower or blocked the fire corridor.\nExamples: \"Emergency stop button covered\", \"Fire corridor partially blocked\", \"Stuff left in front of the emergency shower\".\nEndangering access routes (4 observations): This category includes causing a tripping and collision hazard on access routes. This was done by leaving things on the stairs, running in the corridors or taking shortcuts outside the marked routes.\nExamples: \"Goods left on the stairs\", \"Employee ran in the corridor\", \"Adjustment in the production room\".\nAlthough the rush also caused other serious risks, such as exposure to chemicals (e.g. \"Inadequate use of protective equipment\", \"Sample container left open\") and process safety risks (e.g. \"Documentation inadequate\", \"Machine cleaning skipped\") was clearly the most common consequence of rushing in this material.",

        "english_name": "Processing time",
        "translation": "Analysis of the processing times of safety observations (2024)\nAverage Processing Time\nBased on this simulated data, the average processing time for safety observations in 2024 is approximately 5 days.\nThe processing time is calculated as the difference in days between the date of the observation (havainto_pvm) and the processing date (havainto_käsitelty_pvm).\nTrends in longer processing times\nBy analysing observations with longer-than-average processing times, clear trends can be identified. A longer processing time is typically associated with observations that are not a simple and immediate measure to correct.\nThe most common reasons for longer processing times are:\n1. Structural repairs and more extensive installation work (Processing time typically 1-3 weeks) These often require an external contractor, special materials or design and cannot be implemented immediately.\nExample: \"Stair step broken\" (12 days) – Repairing concrete requires preparation, drying time and possibly special expertise.\nExample: \"Worn floor covering\" (21 days) – Renewing a cleanroom floor covering is an extensive job that requires a production break and a special contractor.\n2. Complex technical faults and investigations (Processing time typically 1-4 weeks) Observations related to the modification of machinery, equipment or systems (e.g. HVAC) for defects whose root cause requires expertise, ordering spare parts or stopping production.\nExample: \"Crane safety limit does not work\" (10 days) – It takes time to troubleshoot and order and install any sensor or part.\nExample: \"Noisy device\" (12 days) – Requires a service examination, noise measurements, and possibly a spare parts order.\nExample: \"Faulty ventilation in a cleanroom\" (24 days) – Requires the presence of an HVAC expert, an examination of the system, and possibly a more extensive repair project.\n3. Improvements that require more extensive planning (Processing time typically > 3 weeks) These findings are not immediate defects, but shortcomings that require planning, budgeting, and a project-based approach to fix. Observations related to ergonomics are a typical example.\nExample: \"Inadequate ergonomics in the packing room\" (31 days) – Improving the ergonomics of a workstation often requires analyzing the work, interviewing several employees, and possibly designing and purchasing a completely new workstation solution.\nSummary: The shortest processing times (1–3 days) are typically for observations that can be corrected immediately by cleaning, organizing, or providing feedback (e.g., Cleanup). \"A puddle of water in the hallway\", \"Stuff left on the stairs\"). Processing times are significantly extended when correcting the observation requires special expertise, spare parts, external contractors or more extensive planning and project work.",
